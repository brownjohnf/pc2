    %p Welcome to the Help Me! page. Jack has written all of this, and therefore it's probably filled with silliness. If you'd like to contribute, get in touch: jack@brownjohnf.com.

      %h4 What's a case study?
      %p Case studios are a way for you to document the work you've done, not only for the edification of future generations of PCVs, but also for your resum√©. You can link to them on a resume, print them and attach them (old school), or simply refer a potential employer to your profile.

      %h4 What's a page?
      %p Pages are a sort of wiki combined with a tradional website. They allow us to host reference material for PCVs and staff, but also show the rest of the world what we're up to. They should always be crisp and professional, and are NOT a place for case studies or any other personal information. Before creating a page, think long and hard about why you're making it, whether your information could better be combined with an existing page, and write it professionally.

      %hr
      %p Shortlinks are currently available for the following resources:
      %ul
        %li Files
        %li Libraries
        %li Pages
      %h4 What are they?
      %p Take a look at a couple of the URLs this app generates:
      %ul
        %li http://www.pcsenegal.org/pages/104-bi-weekly-food-security-update
        %li http://www.pcsenegal.org/pages/178-overview-of-food-security-grant-application-process
      %p Those are a mouthful, huh? Now, imagine you want to tweet or post these URLs. Or maybe put them in an email. Or tattoo them on some tiny piece of your body. It'd be a challenge, wouldn't it? (Actually, for a tattoo I'd recommend a #{link_to 'QR code', '#qrcodes'}.) Shortlinks take those long URLs and turn them into these:
      %ul
        %li http://bit.ly/JOnp0E
        %li http://bit.ly/IEdCYy
      %p Believe it or not, those are the same as the ones above. Well, actually, there <em>better</em> than the ones above, because they also include info for Google Analytics which lets us know how many people used those URLs instead of the long ones.
      %h4 How do I use them?
      %p
        Easy! Just look for the
        %i.icon-resize-small
        icon and click on it. A modal window will drop down with your shortened link. Use at will.
      %h4 Why isn't it a link I can click on/copy easily?
      %p Modern browsers are smart enough to automatically decode bit.ly shortened URLs. To retain its value, you need to copy it manially. Sorry.
      %h4 Why should I care?
      %p Maybe you shouldn't. No, seriously. If you're just posting something on your Facebook wall, use whatever you want. Obviously, if <em>you</em> are the one clicking the link (like you're saving it for later) there's no point in shortening it. BUT, if you're running a campaign, or just curious about how many people are clicking your link, use the shortcode, and shoot your site admins an email. They'll be able to tell you. Cool, huh?
      %h4 I want to build my own campaign URL
      %p Nice. You should. Use this: #{link_to 'Google Campaign URL Builder', "http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=55578"}.
    %section#qrcodes
      %h2 QR Codes
      %hr
      %p QR codes are currently available for the following resources:
      %ul
        %li Files
        %li Libraries
        %li Pages
      %h4 What are they?
      %blockquote
        .floatright= image_tag "http://bit.ly/JY1vYV.qrcode", :rel => 'popover-left', :title => 'This is a QR code', 'data-content' => "This is the QR code for this page (http://www.pcsenegal.org/help#qrcodes). All I've done is embed an image with this URL: http://bit.ly/JY1vYV.qrcode."
        QR Codes storing addresses and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might need information. Users with a camera phone equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR Code to display text, contact information, connect to a wireless network, or open a web page in the telephone's browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed hardlinking or object hyperlinking. QR Codes may also be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR Code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR Code itself is associated with a location.

      %h4 Why would I use them?
      %p For PCVs and Staff members, there's not a great deal of practical application for these little guys. To be useful, most PCVs/Staff would need camera phones, and be reading links distributed on printed materials.
      %p However, any document you're creating for distribution outside the PC Post, it's advisable to slap one on it, because their use is expanding rapidly in the States. The CED Newsletter is considering including a QR code in their next issue. Stay tuned.
      %h4 How do I use them?
      %p Luckily for you, most of the work is done. The basic process for a quality QR Code is:
      %ol
        %li Determine what URL you want to encode. Call it URL A.
        %li Append a Google Analytics tracking string to the end, so you know that traffic generated by the QR code is coming from the QR code. Call this URL B.
        %li Run the whole smear (URL B) through a shortening service (this app uses Bit.ly). This will give you URL C.
        %li Turn URL C into a QR Code using a service online; if you've used Bit.ly, just append '.qrcode' to the URL. This is URL D, and is actuall pointing to a .png (Your QR code!)
      %p
        I know, sounds like a lot of work, doesn't it? Don't worry, this app will do all the heavy lifting for you! Just visit the resource you want to encode, and click the
        %i.icon-qrcode
        icon. There's the image. Download it and do as you like with it. It's really that easy.
      %h4 I want to know exactly how many people are scanning my QR code
      %p What a fantastic idea! You're a thinker. To get that info, you need to create a custom Google Analytics (which your admin already runs on the site, most likely) campaign code. Stay tuned for info. In the meantime, talk to Jack.
      %p Okay, Jack, that's great, but I want to embed my QR code in an email! Oh dear. That's going to require an HTML email, which is something we'll cover elsewhere. Stay tuned.
