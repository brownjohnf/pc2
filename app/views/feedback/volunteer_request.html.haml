      %p You can also send an email to admin@pcsenegal.org, if you like. This form is probably more efficient.
      %p If you DO send us an email, be sure to send it from the one which you used to sign in (the one displayed in your #{link_to 'profile', user_path(current_user)}, and include your name and country of service. We need to verify that you did/do in fact serve there.
      %p If this is related to the 50th anniversary timeline, you can also submit content to 50th@pcsenegal.org.
