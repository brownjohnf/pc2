This is a demo app which offers instant support for login using:

* Facebook
* Google
* Twitter
* Traditional username/password

It's target user group is Peace Corps posts. The structure is customized to reflect their needs, and offers support for the storage, presentation, and manipulation of the following resources:

#### Files

All sorts, including

* photos
* office docs
* PDFs
* spreadsheets

#### Users

Allows anyone to sign up for the site, has restricted access to certain resources based on permission groups. Allows users to be designated as volunteers or staff members, and tracks info such as COS date, sector, job position, etc.

#### Pages

Supports in-browser creation, management, and editing of 'static' pages. Has a built-in WYSIWYG editor, so almost no HTML knowledge is required. Supports Markdown, as well.

#### Case Studies

Similar to pages, but stored separately.

#### Libraries

Libraries allow users to build collections of files, pages, case studies, photos, and users around any theme, and then access or download the resources as a group.

## Requirements

#### PostgreSQL

To use the search functions in the app, you must be running on PostgreSQL. It's possible to develop/test with SQLite, but the tests/actions involving searches will fail.

## Installation on Heroku

#### Purchase and Configure Domain

#### Pick a Heroku app name

#### Set up Facebook App

#### Set up a Google Analytics account

#### Set up Amazon S3

need a bucket name, key, and secret

#### Set up Amazon Route 53 (should be optional, but need to set up DNS)

need root domain pointing to Heroku IP, subs pointing to heroku appname

#### Set up Amazon CloudFront (should be optional)

#### Create Bit.ly account (required)

This will allow you to use the Bit.ly URL shortening and QR Code generation service. You will need an API username and key.

#### Branch / clone app from Git

#### Configure code

Set up MailGun settings. You need to edit the domain property, and use your Heroku domain. For example, our app is running at pcsenegal-production.herokuapp.com. That's what you use for the domain.

    # app/environments/production.rb

    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :port           => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_PORT'], 
      :address        => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_SERVER'],
      :user_name      => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN'],
      :password       => ENV['MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD'],
      :domain         => '<your heroku domain here>',
      :authentication => :plain,
    }
    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp

Configure the host in Devise's confirmation mailer. This time use your forward-facing domain. For us, it's www.pcsenegal.org.

    # app/views/devise/mailer/confirmation_instructions.html.erb

    <p><%= link_to 'Confirm my account', confirmation_url(@resource, :host => '<your domain here>', :confirmation_token => @resource.confirmation_token) %></p>

Set up Facebook and YouTube redirects

    match '/facebook' => redirect('<link to your fb page/group/etc>')
    match '/youtube' => redirect('<link to youtube channel>')
    match '/twitter' => redirect('<link to twitter feed>')

#### Create Heroku App

#### Push app to Heroku to initialize environment

#### Add domain to Heroku app

    heroku domains:add <domain name> --app <appname>

      S3_SECRET=<s3 secret>
      BITLY_USERNAME=<bitly api username>
      BITLY_KEY=<bitly api key>
